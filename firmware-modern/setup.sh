=== Ready ===
  Kernel source:  $SRC_DIR
  Boot source:    $BOOT_DIR  (U-Boot, embeddedsw, bootgen - no linux/, no buildroot/)

  Build everything, BOOT.bin included, from an XSA:
      # run from: the repo root
      ./devkit build --target modern --xsa FILE.xsa

  The XSA is required: the modern target has no Vivado path. Use the one from
  your own factory build (firmware/src/hdl/projects/pluto/system_top.xsa), or the
  system_top.xsa attached to a FACTORY release - knowing that a release's XSA is
  that release's design, not necessarily what your board runs.

  U-Boot and the kernel need an ARM Linux cross-compiler. If this machine has
  none, run the same command through the build container, which does:
      ./devkit container build --target modern --xsa FILE.xsa
