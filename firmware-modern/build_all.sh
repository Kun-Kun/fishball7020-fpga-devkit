#     ./devkit container build --target modern --xsa FILE.xsa   # no cross-compiler here?

#
#     --xsa FILE         REQUIRED, except with --rootfs-only. The hardware
#                        platform, with its bitstream.
#     --boot-only        BOOT.bin and uEnv.txt only; skip the kernel. Works on a
#                        machine that has never built one.
#     --rootfs-only      Only the Debian root filesystem, rootfs.tar, which
#                        write-card puts on the card's second partition. Runs
#                        firmware-modern/debian/build.sh. Needs podman or docker,
#                        so run it on the host, not in ./devkit container.
#     --all              Everything: the boot files, then the Debian root.
#     --preflight-only   Check tools and sources, build nothing.
#
# Writes firmware-modern/output/: BOOT.bin, uImage, devicetree.dtb, uEnv.txt.
# The Debian root, firmware-modern/debian/rootfs.tar, is built only on request
# (--rootfs-only or --all): it needs armhf emulation and takes far longer than
# everything else here.
#
# COMPILER. Either ARM Linux cross-compiler works: gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi (soft
# float, what the container has) or gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf (hard float, the one
# Arch and most distros package). With the hard-float one, U-Boot's
# -march=armv7-a probe used to fail and fall through to a bogus "unrecognized
# -march target: armv5"; U-Boot is now compiled with -mfloat-abi=soft, which
# fixes the probe and changes nothing else (#9).
#
# WHAT THIS IS. The factory target's firmware/scripts/build_all.sh builds all of
# the vendor monorepo - its 5.15 kernel and its Buildroot root filesystem too.
# This builds ONLY what the modern target uses: the FSBL and U-Boot for BOOT.bin,
# from the same pinned sources (firmware/scripts/fetch_common.sh), and ADI's
# patched 6.12 kernel from firmware-modern/src/linux. GIVEN THE SAME XSA, the
# BOOT.bin it packages is the factory one rebuilt: same FSBL, same bitstream, same
# U-Boot source. Given another XSA it is that XSA's design, which is the point.
#
# WHY --xsa IS REQUIRED. The modern target has no Vivado path, and no default
# would be honest: at the time of writing no published release carries the
# bitstream a from-source factory build produces, so silently downloading one
# would silently build a different FPGA design. Pass the platform you mean.
