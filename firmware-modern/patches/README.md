# The modern target's kernel patches

Eight of the factory target's driver patches, rebased onto Analog Devices' Linux
6.12 instead of the vendor's 5.15, plus one patch that exists only here (`0019`).
The rationale for each carried patch is in the factory catalogue,
[`firmware/patches/README.md`](../../firmware/patches/README.md); this page
records what changed on 6.12 and how the series behaves on the board.

```bash
# run from: firmware-modern/src/linux
for p in ../../patches/*.patch; do git apply "$p" || break; done
```

Apply them in filename order. Three chains edit each other's added lines:
`0004 → 0005 → 0012` and `0004 → 0015 → 0017`, and `0016` and `0018` both touch
`ad9361_set_tx_atten()`. A patch applied out of turn fails with a reject, not a
wrong build.

| patch | what it does | on 6.12 |
|---|---|---|
| [`0004`](#0004-mute-tx-when-no-dma-stream) | mute TX when no DMA stream is running | **new code** |
| `0005` | don't clobber a gain set before streaming | context only |
| `0007` | `tx_sample_gpio_en` sysfs attribute | context only |
| `0012` | user LED follows the transmitter | context only |
| [`0015`](#0015-mute-the-transmitter-when-the-dac-starves) | mute when the DAC starves | **new code** |
| `0016` | a `tx_disable` latch debugfs cannot clear | context only |
| `0017` | count transmit DMA underflows | context only |
| `0018` | refuse to transmit louder when the die is hot | context only |
| [`0019`](#0019-never-restore-a-cached-attenuation-of-zero) | never restore a cached attenuation of zero | **new**, not on the factory target |

"Context only" means the added lines are byte-for-byte identical to the 5.15
patch; only the surrounding context moved. To check, extract the added lines of
the 5.15 patch and of the 6.12 one and diff them. `0004`, `0015` and `0017` were
applied by hand because a hunk's context had moved, and of those only `0004` and
`0015` needed different code.

Some terms: **TX** is transmit; **attenuation** is how far the transmit output is
turned down, from 0 dB (full power) to −89.75 dB (the floor, "muted"); a **DMA
buffer** is the block of samples a program hands the kernel to send; **debugfs**
is the kernel's debug file interface under `/sys/kernel/debug`.

## 0004: mute TX when no DMA stream

Two code changes against 5.15:

- `of_find_spi_device_by_node()` is static in 6.12, so a local two-line
  equivalent replaces it.
- `cf_axi_dds_configure_buffer()` was rewritten upstream around
  `devm_iio_dmaengine_buffer_setup_with_ops()`, so the mute hooks attach
  differently.

**It also fixes an upstream bug.** ADI's 6.12 never assigns
`indio_dev->setup_ops` in `cf_axi_dds_configure_buffer()`. Up to 5.15 that
function built the buffer by hand and ended with the assignment. The helper it
now calls takes an `iio_dma_buffer_ops` (submit/abort), not an
`iio_buffer_setup_ops`, so it does not make the assignment either. gcc warns:

```
warning: 'dds_buffer_setup_ops' defined but not used
```

Without it, `dds_buffer_preenable()` and `dds_buffer_postdisable()` never run:
`cf_axi_dds_start_sync()` is skipped when a transmit stream starts, and
`cf_axi_dds_datasel(st, -1, DATA_SEL_DDS)` is skipped when it stops, which leaves
the DAC pointed at stale DMA data. `0004` restores the line, with a comment in
the source saying it is not part of the fishball changes. Status: **not yet
reported upstream.**

**Its root-filesystem half is not here.** The factory `0004` and `0012` also edit
`buildroot/board/pluto/S21misc` (`tx_quiesce` and `tx_led`). This target's
userspace is the Debian root in [`../debian/`](../debian/README.md), which has
no `S21misc`, so those halves are not carried here. The Debian root implements
both itself: `fishball-rf-quiesce` honours `tx_quiesce`, and `fishball-identity`
honours `tx_led`.

Any root filesystem used with this kernel has to reimplement `tx_quiesce` as
something that runs before anything can stream. The two layers split the boot:
this target's device tree ([`../dts/`](../dts/)) sets
`adi,tx-attenuation-mdB = <89750>`, which covers probe, and `tx_quiesce` covers
everything from then to the first stream. ADI's own device trees set `<10000>`
(10 dB of attenuation), which on a board with a power amplifier is roughly
**+9 dBm out of an SMA**
([`docs/debian-root-reference.md`](../../docs/debian-root-reference.md#transmitter-safety-at-boot)).

## 0015: mute the transmitter when the DAC starves

Which field carries the cyclic flag depends on `CONFIG_IIO_DMA_BUF_MMAP_LEGACY`.
The patch handles both.

## 0019: never restore a cached attenuation of zero

**The defect.** `0004` restores a cached attenuation when it unmutes. That cache
(`tx1_atten_cached` / `tx2_atten_cached`) lived in `struct ad9361_rf_phy_state`,
and `ad9361_clear_state()` does `memset(st, 0, sizeof(*st))` on it. debugfs
`initialize` calls `ad9361_clear_state()`. Zero is not a harmless default for an
attenuation: 0 mdB is full output. So this sequence keyed the transmitter flat
out with nothing having asked for it:

```sh
# run on the board. On a kernel without 0019, with an antenna fitted, do NOT.
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/iio/iio:device0/initialize
# ...then anything that opens a transmit buffer...
```

On the board, `0016`'s test (set the latch, run debugfs `initialize`, check the
latch held) left **TX2 at 0.000000 dB with an antenna fitted**, and nothing had
written a gain at any point.

**The fix.** The cache moves to `struct ad9361_rf_phy`, which
`ad9361_clear_state()` does not touch, and is seeded at probe with
`MAX_TX_ATTENUATION_DB`, so "nothing cached yet" means muted rather than loud.

This is the third safety field moved out of that struct: `0016`'s `tx_disable`
latch and `0018`'s `tx_temp_limit` were moved for the same reason. The
`verify-modern` CI workflow asserts where all three live. Do not put a
safety-relevant field in `ad9361_rf_phy_state`.

It is not a 6.12 regression. The factory target's 5.15 kernel has the same code
and does not carry this patch, so there a debugfs `initialize` must be followed by
a re-mute and a read-back
([`docs/transmitter-safety.md`](../../docs/transmitter-safety.md)).

## On the board

Kernel 6.12.0, the same bitstream as the factory target:

| | |
|---|---|
| `./devkit selftest` | 23 passed, 0 warnings, 0 failed |
| TX0 / TX1 at probe | **−89.75 dB** both |
| `tx_starve_timeout_ms` | 250 |
| `tx_cyclic_timeout_ms` | 0 as the driver compiles it; a booted devkit Debian root reads **60000**, because `fishball-rf-quiesce` sets it before `iiod` starts. To see the driver's own value, `fw_setenv tx_cyclic_bound 0` and reboot. Stopping the unit does not reset it (the value it wrote stays), and stopping it also stops `iiod` |
| `tx_disable`, `tx_temp_limit`, `tx_sample_gpio_en`, `tx_dma_{under,over}flow_count` | present, 0 |
| `0016` behaviourally | latch set to 1, debugfs `initialize`, latch **still 1** and still −89.75 dB |
| `0015` starvation mute | **0.26–0.27 s** after `kill -9` on the feeder, with `buffer/enable` still 1; the same figure as on 5.15 |
| `0017` counters | 0 → 657 underflows during a starved stream, and a write zeroes them |
| `0018` thermal gate | limit 1 °C at a 40 °C die: an explicit −60 dB write refused and logged, muting still allowed |
| `0019` | `initialize` then a transmit stream: both channels stay at −89.75 dB |
| RF loopback, TX0→RX0 through 20 dB | **32 passed, 0 failed**. TX attenuator 1.007 dB/dB, image rejection below the noise floor, mute depth 73.1 dB to the floor |
| digital loopback error | 0.0 dB, `dig_eye_passes` 157 |

Re-run the `0016` and `0019` checks by hand after any change to `ad9361.c`. Both
patches exist to survive another code path's reset, and a passing selftest
exercises neither.

## Testing pitfalls

- **`pkill` is not in the board's busybox.** A starvation test that calls it never
  kills the writer, the watchdog keeps being re-armed, and the test reports the
  watchdog as broken. Kill by PID from `ps`.
- **Feed the stream from something endless.** A 1 MB file at 61.44 MS/s lasts
  4 ms, so the buffer closes normally before the kill and the test measures the
  ordinary close path. `cat /dev/urandom |` keeps it live.
- **Do not `sleep` straight after `kill -9` on a background job in busybox `sh`.**
  It returns on SIGCHLD, so the reading lands about 10 ms after the kill. Poll
  `/proc/uptime` instead.
