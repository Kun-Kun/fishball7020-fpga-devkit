# --from DIR takes BOOT.bin, uImage, devicetree.dtb and uEnv.txt from DIR - a
# downloaded modern release - instead of firmware-modern/output/. If DIR has the
# release's SHA256SUMS, every boot file listed there is checked against it first.
#
# --image FILE writes the same layout into a new file through a loop device, so
# the whole path - partitioning, both filesystems, every copy - can be exercised
# without a card. It does NOT relax any check on a real device: those checks stay
# exactly as they are, and apply to anything that is not a file this run created.
#
# THIS DESTROYS EVERYTHING ON THE TARGET. It refuses any device that is not
# removable and anything that is a partition rather than a whole disk, unmounts
# the target's own partitions (as listed by lsblk), and prints what it is about to
# do first - then makes you type the device name. The one mistake this class of script
# makes is writing to the wrong disk, so it would rather be annoying.
#
# The layout is forced rather than chosen: the Zynq BootROM reads BOOT.bin from a
# FAT partition, so p1 must be FAT and the Debian root goes on p2.
