#   firmware-modern/build_all.sh --xsa      the modern target (which has no Vivado
#                                           path at all, so it ALWAYS comes here)
# Before it existed this logic lived inline in build_all.sh, and a second target
# would have meant a second copy of every refusal below - the kind of duplicate
# that drifts until the two targets accept different files.

# Everything here refuses early and in one sentence, because the alternative is a
# confusing failure three stages later in the FSBL build.
