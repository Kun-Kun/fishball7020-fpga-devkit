# AMD's bootgen, which packages BOOT.bin. This used to be the one Xilinx binary
# still required, and the reason Vivado had to be INSTALLED even for an --xsa
# build that never ran it. AMD publishes the source under Apache 2.0, it builds
# in about five seconds against system OpenSSL, and the BOOT.bin it produces is
# byte-identical to the one Vivado's copy produces - verified against an image a
# board has booted. Built always, and always used, so that what comes out does
# not depend on which Xilinx tools happen to be installed.

#
# "Exists" was the old test, and it is not enough. A bootgen built on a host with
# a new glibc does not run in the Ubuntu 22.04 build container:
#     bootgen: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.38' not found
# Found when the modern target's first container build got through the FSBL,
# U-Boot, the kernel and uEnv.txt and then failed to package. The factory target
# has the same exposure; its bootgen worked in the container only because it had
# last been built there. A binary built against the OLDER glibc runs on both,
# so rebuilding wherever it will not run converges instead of ping-ponging.
# The run-here probe captures bootgen's output rather than piping it into
# `grep -q`: every caller runs under `set -o pipefail`, where grep -q exits on the
# first match, bootgen takes SIGPIPE, and the pipeline reports failure - so a
# WORKING bootgen would be rebuilt and then declared broken. setup.sh records the
# same trap for git status.
