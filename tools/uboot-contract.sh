# What the bootloader must still do after you replace it.
#
#     # run from: the repo root
#     ./tools/uboot-contract.sh            # check the running board
#     ./tools/uboot-contract.sh --save     # record today's answers as the baseline
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# U-Boot here is 2016.07, and replacing it with mainline is a reasonable thing to
# want. The danger is not that the board fails to boot - you find that out
# immediately. It is that it boots perfectly and quietly stops doing one of the
# half-dozen other jobs the bootloader has on this board, none of which a boot
# test exercises. The worst case is `ethaddr`: lose it and the Ethernet MAC goes
# random every boot, which is the exact defect firmware/patches/0013 exists to
# fix, and the symptom appears days later as "the router keeps giving it a new
# address".
#
# So: run this BEFORE touching the bootloader, with --save. Run it after. Diff.
#
# It checks what is observable from Linux. The things that are not - whether
# `preboot` ran, what `modeboot` was - are inferred from their consequences,
# which is the honest way round: a variable being readable proves more than a
# log line saying it was read.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, deliberately:
#   - the QSPI/DFU boot paths. Nothing here uses them, `./devkit flash` is the
#     supported route, and DFU has bricked units on this board.
#   - whether U-Boot itself has a network stack. It does not
#     (`# CONFIG_NET is not set`), and nothing needs it to.
