# Measure receive throughput on the board, one kernel at a time, with a method
# that does not change between runs.
#
#     # run from: the repo root
#     ./tools/throughput-ab.sh                    # one round on whatever is booted
#     BOARD=192.168.1.50 ./tools/throughput-ab.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is a script rather than a paragraph.
#
# The local figures in docs/modulation-and-throughput.md were measured with
# iio_readdev at 33.6 Msamples, and iio_readdev's process start and its buffer
# allocation sit INSIDE the timed window. At 61.44 MS/s that run is 0.7 s, so a
# sixth of the measurement is fixed cost. Run the identical command with four
# times the samples and the same board reports 20% more.
#
# That is enough to invent a regression. It nearly did: re-measuring after the
# 6.12 rebase gave 183 MB/s against the 199 recorded for 5.15, which reads as a
# 7% loss until you notice the long run gives 220.
#
# So this script fixes everything that can drift - tool, buffer size, sample
# rate, sample counts, repeats - and reports both a short and a long run, because
# the difference between them IS the measurement's own overhead.
#
# It reads only. Nothing here opens a transmit buffer, which matters on a kernel
# without firmware-modern/patches/0019: there, an unmute restores a cache that
# clear_state() may have zeroed, and zero attenuation is full output.
#
# WHAT THE A/B FOUND, 2026-09-27, interleaved 6.12 -> 5.15 -> 6.12 on one board:
# the kernel makes no difference at all. Every figure matched across all three
# rounds, and the run-to-run scatter within one kernel (341.8-346.4 MB/s) was
# larger than any difference between them. Neither kernel reproduces the recorded
# 199.3 / 369.4 at 33.6 Msamples; both give 183 / 346 there and 220 / 431 at
# 134.4 M. The published numbers differ by METHOD, not by kernel.

Read the two sample counts as one measurement, not two. The gap between them is
this tool's own startup cost, not the board changing its mind - so quote the long
run, and compare against someone else's figure only at the SAME sample count.
NOTE
