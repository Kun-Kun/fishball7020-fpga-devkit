# EXIT INT TERM IS NOT ENOUGH ON THIS BOARD. /bin/sh is dash, and dash does NOT run
# an EXIT trap when the shell dies on an untrapped fatal signal. Measured on this
# board: TERM runs the trap; HUP, PIPE and QUIT kill it outright and the trap never
# fires. These scripts are launched as `ssh fishball "sh /tmp/<script> <ch>"`, so a
# dropped session delivers HUP, and the first printf into the dead stdout takes PIPE -
# and the writer and feeder do NOT die with it, because their output is redirected.
# The board would sit at -30 dB streaming with nothing left to mute it.
# MEASURED ON THIS BOARD, not assumed: with the list below, TERM, HUP and PIPE all run
# the trap. QUIT does NOT - dash accepts the trap (it lists in `trap`) and then dies
# without running it, twice out of two. QUIT is kept because it costs nothing and works
# under a /bin/sh that is not dash, but do not count on it here: Ctrl-\ on this board
# leaves the transmitter up. Ctrl-C (INT) is trapped and is the one to use.
# A TRAPPED SIGNAL DOES NOT TERMINATE THE SHELL. The handler runs and then execution
# RESUMES at the next statement - demonstrated, not assumed. Round 7 widened this list
# from EXIT INT TERM to include HUP PIPE QUIT and did not add an exit, which turned
# "dies with TX up" into something worse: the handler muted and revoked, the script
# carried on to the next case, opened a TX buffer, and the kernel's cache restore put
# the port back at the last stream's -30 dB with the operator's session already gone.
# Revoking leaves both attenuators at exactly -89.75, which tx-guard.sh LIMIT 3 records
# as the state that ARMS that restore.
#
# So: EXIT does the mute, and every signal arm mutes and then EXITS. The handler masks
# the signals first, because with PIPE trapped on a dead stdout every remaining echo
# re-enters the handler.
