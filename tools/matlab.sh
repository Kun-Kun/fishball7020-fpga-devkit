  MATLAB is not installed here, or its bin directory is not on PATH. Set
  MATLAB_BIN to the binary if it lives somewhere unusual:

      MATLAB_BIN=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2026a/bin/matlab ./devkit matlab

  Everything in matlab/+fishball that does not need live radio also works
  without MATLAB at all - see docs/matlab.md for the capture-file route.
